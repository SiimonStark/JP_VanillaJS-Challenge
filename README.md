**One Night || Solo: (Vanilla JS) Challenge Project**
## Summary:
- Learning goal of this project was to go back and practice Vanilla JS. Because we have been working in React and Redux for awhile now. This was very challenging to finish in just one night!! Originally we had a week and a half as a 3 person group project.
